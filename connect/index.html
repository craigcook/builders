				<h2> The Mission. </h2>
				<p>Our investment program is designed for companies that don't need or want to be part of a cohorted program right now, but still see a strong benefit in building a <strong>long term relationship with Mozilla given a shared mission</strong>. We are looking for seed-stage companies that have already launched a product and have some initial traction. On some occasions, we might participate in series A.</p>
				<p>Within the wide "Fix the Internet" focus, we are <strong>specially interested</strong> in working with founders that are innovating around <strong>dweb, privacy, browser and crypto</strong>. If you are a founder and would like to work with us, here is how to get in touch.</p>
				<p>As part of our partnership, we will explore with you if there are some strategic areas in your entrepreneurial journey where we can add strategic value. Here are some of the people in our network that we'll be able to leverage for that: Tanya Soman, Kathy Pham, Holly Liu, Maria Alegre, Mark Mayo, Mitchell Baker, Adam Seligman, Leslie Gray, Lindsey Shepard, Eric Rescorla and more. We also can help you connect with specific engineering, scalability and open source advisors for office hours and advice when/if helpful. Last but not least, we can also make intros among some of you (with respect, we recognize how busy founders are). </p>
				<p>We offer optional monthly check ins / office hours, and we run some quarterly events that you might benefit from. </p>
