The internet's amazing, weird, sometimes a little icky. Let’s face it: it could use some fixing. Are you a student, coder, designer, creator who wants to help us build new services and platforms that foster collaboration during this crisis, or put privacy first, or combat filter bubbles and polarization, or AI platforms that work for the end user, the citizen? Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet MVP Lab is an 8 week-long incubator-style program this Spring to mobilize & fund around products and technologies that enable everyone to connect and build a better society.

## About

Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet Incubator was started by a leading computer scientist & product leader (currently on faculty at Harvard), the former CTO of Joyent (node.js) and SVP Firefox, and two seasoned entrepreneurs (with a combined 10 exits and 25 #1 app store hits). Join us and a world class group of your peers in learning together, and building the next billion-user application that makes the internet live up to its full potential.
